# attack-type-prediction
This one is based on kaggle dataset [Global Terrorism Databse](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd) (Origin - National Consortium START). There is a column which gives a summary of the attack in an average of 45 words. Will train a simple model to predict the kind of attack (out of 9 types), such as hostage taking or armed assault etc. 
The original table 135 columns, mostly due to same column represented in various data types. Such as the attack type has 6 columns where only the numerical one (or perhaps txt one) will be useful.
Will upload results ...
